                       <h3>Every Mario Game,ranked</h3>
                       <p>The Super Mario series is 35 years old, and reported rumors 
                           strongly suggest that Nintendo will be remastering the
                           franchise’s greatest 3D outings for the Nintendo Switch.

                        In case you’ve just come out of a warp pipe after 35 years, 
                        Mario is THE video game character. The first Super Mario Bros. 
                        In 1985 essentially rescued the video game industry. 
                        Having appeared in more than 200 titles, Mario fronts the 
                        best-selling video game franchise of all time with 600 million 
                        sold since his first appearance in 1981′s Donkey Kong. 
                        Mario games either invent or elevate entire genres, 
                        like Super Mario Kart starting the battle kart trend, 
                        or Super Smash Bros. inventing the party fighter.
                        
                        With 19 different titles across the “main” series of 
                        Super Mario games, each title hits different for different people. 
                        An objective ranking of core Mario titles is impossible; 
                        Still, we’ll try our best. Many of these games are likely 
                        interchangeable depending on a variety of personal factors, 
                        including mood, nostalgia and preference. 
                        In fact, every game on this list is at least very good, 
                        with the best ranking among greatest games ever made. 
                        Even the worst Mario game is usually just fine.</p>

                    <h3>Secret Game Over Trick Continues To Blow Peoples Minds</h3>
                    <p>People who struggle with the original Super Mario Bros. 
                        Can now easily finish the game, as an old game over trick 
                        has been blowing people's minds on the Internet. 
                        Super Mario Bros. is one of the best-selling video games of 
                        all time and Nintendo has made sure to keep the game in the 
                        hands of fans through services like the Nintendo Switch Online 
                        app or the Virtual Console.

                        Nintendo has been producing popular games since the '80s, 
                        but many of them had secrets that went undiscovered for decades. 
                        It took thirty years for a secret in Punch-Out!! to be revealed, 
                        as a bearded man in the audience moves at the exact right time 
                        that the player needs to punch, in order to knock out Piston Honda or Bald Bull. 
                        The Super Mario Bros. series is no stranger to secrets, as it was recently 
                        discovered that the fire animation in Super Mario 64 is glitched and 
                        it took fans twenty years to notice.</p>

                    <h3>Nintendo Set to Remaster Most of Its  Games 
                        for 35th Anniversary of Nintendo</h3>
                    <p>Nintendo is reportedly working on remasters for most of Super Mario's 
                        35-year back catalogue for the Nintendo Switch, as part of the 35th anniversary 
                        celebration for Super Mario Bros. The company will reveal its plans for these 
                        releases at an event that will mark the 35-year milestone. 
                        The remasters include 1997's Super Mario 64, 2002's Super Mario Sunshine, 
                        Super Mario Galaxy, and many more. The company plans on re-releasing some of its 
                        old games as well and is said to be working on a new Paper Mario game.

                        According to a report by Video Games Chronicle, Nintendo plans on having a major event 
                        to celebrate its 35-year anniversary for the Super Mario games, 
                        the first of which was released in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
                         and was called Super Mario Bros. The reports state that the 
                         remasters for the Nintendo Switch will include 1997's Super Mario 64, 2002's Super Mario Sunshine,
                          2007's Super Mario Galaxy, among others.</p>

                    <h3>Nintendo Soars 18% As Super Mario iPhone Debut Surprises Market</h3>
                    <p>Tokyo: Shares of Nintendo Co surged as much as 18 percent on Thursday, 
                        propelled by a surprise announcement at Apple Inc's iPhone launch event 
                        of the debut of the Japanese firm's popular game franchise Super Mario Bros on the iPhone. 

                        Investors are betting the new game, Super Mario Run, will be another mobile hit 
                        for the Japanese company akin to the wildly popular Pokemon GO, as it moves 
                        away from its console-focused strategy and embraces on-the-go gaming. 
                        
                        "Launching a well-known Nintendo character on the globally penetrated 
                        iPhone is one of the best scenarios that investors have hoped for," 
                        Tomoaki Kawasaki, an analyst at Iwai Cosmo Securities, said.</p>

                    <h3>Super Mario Bros Luxury Watch Launched at $18,950</h3>
                    <p>If your idea of luxury is having a plumber in a red shirt 
                        and blue overalls on a watch, your dream has come true. 
                        Swiss luxury watchmaker Romain Jerome has unveiled its 
                        collaboration with Nintendo, a limited edition mechanical 
                        watch featuring the titular character of Super Mario Bros, 
                        on the 30th anniversary of the original game released for the NES.

                        This isn't the first time the watchmaker has gone the arcade game route, though. 
                        It has previously collaborated with other 8-bit franchises such as Space Invaders, 
                        Tetris, and Pac-Man to produce modern watches with retro game characters. 
                        The new watch is called RJ Super Mario Bros.</p>
